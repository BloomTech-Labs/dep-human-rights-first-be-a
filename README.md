# Human Rights First Police Use of Force Map - Back End
## About
Our team is developing an interactive map that identifies potential instances of police use of force across the United States of America for [Human Rights First](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/), an independent advocacy and action organization. We are also developing additional graphics to track and display police brutality trends.

## Contributing
#### Getting started tips:
 * [Connecting to postgres](https://docs.labs.lambdaschool.com/api/)
 * Run the following commands before a commit so github checks pass(or set up format on save):
    * 'npm run lint'
    * 'npm run lint:fix'
    * 'npm run format'
#### The following are future features needed/desired for this project:
* Populating the back end with a full data set from the DS API. The DS API is still in development so seeded data is currently being used for front end visualizations. Some specific changes that may be needed include:
  * A table to store the type of incident (i.e. 'tear gas'), and possibly an intermediary table to connect incidents by type and allow filtering to occur on the backend.
  * A field for the origin in the 'sources' table (i.e. twitter)
  * Additional fields in the incidents table to accommodate demographic information retrieved from police records. This might also require a separate table just for police data.
  * An endpoint for retrieving police data
  * Scheduling. A system needs to set up to periodically populate the back end database with updates from the DS API. Our backend team originally planned to use 'node-cron', however it does not work with a Heroku deployment. Heroku does have a free scheduler add on that should work with the current usage package.

* User profiles. In the future users should be able to have a personal profile to save incidents and search results. Some features that are needed:
  * A table to store saved incidents
  * Implementing Okta Auth - There is some set up from the [API starter code](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs-api-starter), but our team did not work on it because it was outside the scope of our roadmap.
